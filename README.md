# THE-HUNT

## Statement Of Purpose

We would like to create a gaming application for NWMSU which works on iPhone SE, Android device, laptop and an iPad. The main motto behind this idea of creating a gaming application is to bring bearcats of diverse departments onto a common platform which helps students to interact, encourages students to unique and special parts of campus, contributes in developing an attitude towards teamwork.

## Overview

We would like to create an app that can be played on a mobile device. The app would encourage players to complete a 'quest' by encountering a specific list of locations. A player would activate one of the locations in the quest. To score that location, the user must enter the geographic area (as determined by their mobile device). Locations may be explicitly identified (easier) - or described using clues (harder). The quest may require locations to be accessed in a specific order - or in any order as specified by the quest creator.

* Team name with their position will be seen in Leaderboard.

## Create-Event Screen:
* This screen is used to create quests and used to invite teams to the quest
* In this module, we use random location picker to assign treasure so that the user who created Event also can play the game
* Teams need to accept the invitation to join the game

[Excel Link](Sample_Data.xlsx)

## Risks and Assumptions
### Risks
#### Risk of Application based security break
* Mobile security threats include everything from mobile forms of malware and spyware to the potential for unauthorized access to a deviceâ€™s data, particularly in the case of   accidental loss or theft of the device.

#### Risk of location access
* The process of poor coding and insecure handling of location data may cause the insecurity in accessing the location.

#### Risk in the Operating System and data retrieval
* Defects in the kernel code and vendor supplied system code may cause the Iphone or android jail breaks.
* Risks in creating or managing the teams.

### Assumptions
* Although responsive design is similar to mobile app design, there is a significant difference in developing apps for any device versus stand alone.
* Symbols are attractive and can be visually attractive to convey information. The results will help to analyze clearly which symbol can be considered most effective in           communicating the action that we wish the users to accomplish. 
* The project scope will not change once the stakeholders sign off on the scope statement
* Bug fix effort for each screen will not exceed 20% of the development effort for same screen.
