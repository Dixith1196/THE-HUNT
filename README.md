# THE-HUNT

## Statement Of Pupose

We would like to create a gaming application for NWMSU which works on iPhone SE, Android device, laptop and an iPad. The main motto behind this idea of creating a gaming application is to bring bearcats of diverse departments onto a common platform which helps students to interact, encourages students to unique and special parts of campus, contributes in developing an attitude towards teamwork.

## Overview

We would like to create an app that can be played on a mobile device. The app would encourage players to complete a 'quest' by encountering a specific list of locations. A player would activate one of the locations in the quest. To score that location, the user must enter the geographic area (as determined by their mobile device). Locations may be explicitly identified (easier) - or described using clues (harder). The quest may require locations to be accessed in a specific order - or in any order as specified by the quest creator.

# Risks and Assumptions

# Risks
## Risk of Application based security break
* Mobile security threats include everything from mobile forms of malware and spyware to the potential for unauthorized access to a deviceâ€™s data, particularly in the case of   accidental loss or theft of the device.

## Risk of location access
* The process of poor coding and insecure handling of location data may cause the insecurity in accessing the location.

## Risk in the Operating System and data retrieval
* Defects in the kernel code and vendor supplied system code may cause the Iphone or android jail breaks.

## Risk of poor authorization and authentication
* Weak authentication and authorization allows an dispute to access the mobile device, or it is anonymous backend.


# Assumptions
## Users must create an account
* As a developer, locking out users is much simpler until an entry in the user database has been solidified. But that's almost skillful from the consumer view point.

## Application design must be same as the responsive web design
* Although responsive design is similar to mobile app design, there is a significant difference in developing apps for any device versus stand alone.
* For mobile devices, consumers anticipate certain interaction patterns and elements of the graphical user interface.

## Symbols can be easily understand by the users
* Symbols are attractive and can be visually attractive to convey information. The results will help to analyze clearly which symbol can be considered most effective in communicating the action that we wish the users to accomplish.
