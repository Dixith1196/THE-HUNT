## Half-Day 1
* On the first half-day, our team had a discussion over the issues raised by client. After reviewing the feedback we have segregated those issues among ourselves and started 
  working on them.
* I have worked on issues raised by our client specific to user stories and JIRA. Mainly, I have spent most of my time in adding few missing points in our documentation such as
  user stories and the workflow of our application from userâ€™s perspective.

## Half-Day 2
* On my second half-day, I have worked on configuring JIRA. From the feedback what we have got from client, I have removed few user stories which were not necessary and added 
  few tasks which we thought were appropriate to add.
* Also worked on setting the priority of Sprint-1 tasks in JIRA
