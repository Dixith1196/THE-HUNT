## Pruthvi Naskanti - Section 02 - Dr. Case

## Half-Day1:

* On day-1, I have worked on my assigned tasks in JIRA which were regarding automatic formatting of code of our application. 
* Have researched on few automatic formatting tools. Installed Prettier on my laptop and included in our project which changed package.json file of our project. Also came to know   more about new automatic formatting softwares which can help us to enforce consistent and clear code-format.
