## Pruthvi Naskanti - Section 02 - Dr. Case

## Half-Day1:

* On day-1, I have worked on my assigned tasks in JIRA which were regarding automatic formatting of code of our application. Have researched on few automatic formatting tools. 
  Installed Prettier on my laptop and included in our project which changed package.json file. Also came to know more about new automatic formatting softwares which can help us 
  to enforce consistent and clear code-format.
